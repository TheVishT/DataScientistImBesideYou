# Data Scientist Deliverable for I'mBesideYou - Vishnu Tirth Bysani

We have been given a dataset of 10 candidates containing the emotion scores, gaze scores, transcript scores, and corresponding transcripts extracted from their introduction videos. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with the help of Prompt Engineering, we need to provide valuable and actionable insights from the data.

After we have an idea of the data using Exploratory Data Analysis, we can predict if the student should be recruited or not. As we do not have explicit labels or target outputs, we need to apply Clustering, which is a type of Unsupervised Learning Algorithm, that groups similar data points based on their feature similarity.
